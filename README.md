This example uses the Angular framework. Frameworks in general are helpful because they offer a lot of robust functionality to help you build an application without having to build all the smaller building blocks first. Angular specifically offers a lot of useful binding methods that can allow you to change data in your Javascript code, and have the HTML view update to match the new data automatically.

However, relying on frameworks can obfuscate what is actually going on in a web app, and can make it difficult if you ever need to do something that the framework doesn't already handle out of the box. It's important to keep that trade-off in mind when choosing what framework to use.
